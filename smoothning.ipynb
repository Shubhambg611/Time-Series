    "Smoothing in time series is a technique used to reduce noise and fluctuations in data to better identify trends, patterns, or seasonality. It helps in making the data easier to analyze and interpret by filtering out short-term variations while preserving the long-term trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Smoothing Techniques:\n",
    "1. **Moving Average Smoothing**:\n",
    "   - Averages data points over a fixed window size.\n",
    "   - Helps in reducing random noise.\n",
    "   - Example: Simple Moving Average (SMA), Weighted Moving Average (WMA).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Exponential Smoothing**:\n",
    "   - Assigns exponentially decreasing weights to older observations.\n",
    "   - More responsive to recent changes in the data.\n",
    "   - Example: Simple Exponential Smoothing, Double Exponential Smoothing (for trends), Triple Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters for seasonality).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Gaussian Smoothing**:\n",
    "   - Uses a Gaussian kernel to smooth the data.\n",
    "   - Often used in signal processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Savitzky-Golay Filter**:\n",
    "   - Fits successive subsets of data points with a polynomial to smooth the data.\n",
    "   - Preserves the shape of the signal better than moving averages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Smoothing is widely used in forecasting, anomaly detection, and understanding underlying patterns in time series data."

    "Here’s an explanation of **Single, Double, and Triple Exponential Smoothing**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Single Exponential Smoothing (SES)**:\n",
    "   - Focuses on smoothing the data by applying exponentially decreasing weights to past observations.\n",
    "   - Best suited for time series data without trends or seasonality.\n",
    "   - Formula:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     S_t = α * X_t + (1 - α) * S_(t-1)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     Where:\n",
    "     - `S_t` is the smoothed value at time `t`.\n",
    "     - `X_t` is the actual value at time `t`.\n",
    "     - `α` is the smoothing factor (0 < α ≤ 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Double Exponential Smoothing (DES)**:\n",
    "   - Extends SES by accounting for trends in the data.\n",
    "   - Uses two equations: one for the level and one for the trend.\n",
    "   - Suitable for time series with a trend but no seasonality.\n",
    "   - Formula:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     Level: L_t = α * X_t + (1 - α) * (L_(t-1) + T_(t-1))\n",
    "     Trend: T_t = β * (L_t - L_(t-1)) + (1 - β) * T_(t-1)\n",
    "     Forecast: F_(t+m) = L_t + m * T_t\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     Where:\n",
    "     - `L_t` is the level at time `t`.\n",
    "     - `T_t` is the trend at time `t`.\n",
    "     - `β` is the trend smoothing factor (0 < β ≤ 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Triple Exponential Smoothing (TES or Holt-Winters)**:\n",
    "   - Extends DES by incorporating seasonality into the model.\n",
    "   - Suitable for time series with both trend and seasonality.\n",
    "   - Uses three equations: one for the level, one for the trend, and one for the seasonality.\n",
    "   - Formula:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     Level: L_t = α * (X_t / S_(t-p)) + (1 - α) * (L_(t-1) + T_(t-1))\n",
    "     Trend: T_t = β * (L_t - L_(t-1)) + (1 - β) * T_(t-1)\n",
    "     Seasonality: S_t = γ * (X_t / L_t) + (1 - γ) * S_(t-p)\n",
    "     Forecast: F_(t+m) = (L_t + m * T_t) * S_(t+m-p)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     Where:\n",
    "     - `S_t` is the seasonal component.\n",
    "     - `p` is the seasonality period.\n",
    "     - `γ` is the seasonality smoothing factor (0 < γ ≤ 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "- **SES**: For data without trend or seasonality.\n",
    "- **DES**: For data with a trend but no seasonality.\n",
    "- **TES**: For data with both trend and seasonality.\n",
